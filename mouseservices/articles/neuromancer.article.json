    "content": "As I write this first line of the review, I have gotta say. I can&rsquo;t see the world the same again. I felt the &ldquo;ice&rdquo;, I feel like I can see the hieroglyphics. This book feels like It changed something deep inside me fundamentally. I can never know enough. The writing in Neuromancer has a poetic feeling to it despite it being in a novel format. The descriptive abilities of William Gibson lend themselves to visualization.\nThe story is set in a future of what might be the US but is referred to rather as the Sprawl. &ldquo;Chiba city&rdquo; and wasteland full of drug dealers, the augmented and addicts is where we find our protagonist. Case is a damaged man, an addled speed addict with neurological damage for messing with the wrong company. He once was a keyboard cowboy as they call it, but now he&rsquo;s nothing more than a thief and a dealer.\nHis life changes when a man named Armitage contacts him for a job. This is a job beyond his wildest dreams, Armitage says he can fix his brain, he will be able to be a keyboard cowboy again. Besides speed, this is all Case wants in his life. Along with Armitage comes a new woman that seems to love him for no real reason, Molly. Molly is an augmented bodyguard. Basically a cyborg and a hired gun. Later in the book, the Zionites call her &ldquo;stepping razor&rdquo; which I think perfectly communicates who she is as a character. Armitage isn&rsquo;t lying about being able to fix his mind but there&rsquo;s a catch with it all, he can&rsquo;t get high even if he wanted to, and if he fucks up the plan his mind gets poisoned all over again.\nThey go after an organization called Tessier-Ashpool, which is basically the vast endless wealth of a family that amounts to royalty. The why they are doing all this remains mostly a mystery to be revealed throughout the book. Whatever the reason it likely isn&rsquo;t human except maybe in desire and attitude.\nThey pick up a few more characters throughout the book. A fence named Finn, a heroin addict pervert named Riveria. An A.I. of his dead friend named Dixie. Along with a handful of other villains and side characters revealed as the mystery unfolds as to what exactly Armitage is doing.\nThe settings in the book are also unbelievable, from Chiba city, to what I believe might be Turkey, to the ultra wealthy&rsquo;s private space resort that is more like the world of now than any other setting in the book. There is Zion with the Zionites are basically a society of Rastas that live on a space station, such long residents that their very biology has been altered by the conditions.\nI think the rest of the story should remain a mystery. The way it unfolds is inspiring, it is a good mystery, with an explosive conclusion. I recommend the book if you are looking for something that is more cyberpunk than anything you have read or seen."
